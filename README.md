# Used Cars Price Prediction

This repository contains scripts for predicting the prices of used cars using two different regression models: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression. These models are trained on a dataset of used car listings, and they can be used to estimate the price of a car based on its features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the regression models is not included in this repository. You can find a suitable dataset for used car listings from various sources like Kaggle or other data providers. The dataset should include features such as the car's brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and price.

## Dependencies

To run the scripts in this repository, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version >= 3.6)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Linear Regression

The `linear_regression.py` script trains a linear regression model on the provided dataset to predict used car prices. It performs data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. 
## Random Forest Regression

The `random_forest_regression.py` script trains a random forest regression model on the provided dataset to predict used car prices. It follows a similar workflow as the linear regression script but uses a different regression algorithm. 

Feel free to explore and modify these scripts to suit your specific needs. Happy predicting!
